# Visual Sorting Algorithms  #

 A visual display of various sorting algorithms using plain Javascript.

## Operation Summary ##
I have programmed popular sorting algorithms as generator functions that yield a new array upon each step of operation (loop/recursion). **sorting-algorithms.js**. The flow of the algorithms, along with the drawing loops, is dictated by the *mainLoop()* in **visual-sort.js**.
